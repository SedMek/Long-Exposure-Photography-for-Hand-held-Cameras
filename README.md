# Long-Exposure-Photography-for-Hand-held-Cameras
The goal of this project is to allow photography amateurs to take stylish long exposure photos using only the regular camera mode, without the need of a tripod.     We will shoot a video of a scene using a hand held camera, stabilize it, then merge the average of different frames to get the long exposure photo using only deterministic methods, no former training needed.
